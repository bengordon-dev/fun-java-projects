# Slay
A crude imitation of Sean O'Connor's classic strategy game. Completed in January 2020 (junior year of high school) for my final project in [Dr. Morrison's](https://faculty.ncssm.edu/~morrison/) Java class.  
Only includes pass-and-play gameplay and a level editor. Significant changes are required.
